If you do happen to read this, I'm happy that I chose you as my partner, and I deeply apologize for how I act the past few days. 
I didnt mean any of those to hurt you badly, and I made this for you. Its not much  as what you made for me, but I hope this little project can somewhat make you feel better.
I know it's kinda stupid that I made one like this when I could've just said this to you through call.
This project came to mind as a reminder of why I decided to commit to this relationship. I plan to improve this later on and make it as a platform to look back and show to our little ones.

I love you so much, Nathaniel. My love
